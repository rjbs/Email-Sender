Revision history for Email-Sender

{{$NEXT}}

2.601     2024-01-17 19:15:25-05:00 America/New_York
        - allow using an Authen::SASL instance via sasl_authenticator as an
          alternative to username asd password (thanks, Erik Huelsmann!)

2.600     2022-10-23 16:45:34-04:00 America/New_York
        - This version replaces the use of Email::Address with
          Email::Address::XS, as the pure perl version has problems with
          certain kinds of input.

2.500     2021-07-04 13:26:47-04:00 America/New_York
        - version bumped to account for change in fractional part precision

1.500     2021-06-20 20:30:24-04:00 America/New_York
        - adjust version number for bookkeeping reasons

1.300036  2021-06-17 09:51:12-04:00 America/New_York
        - add "maybestarttls" option, to allow opportunistic STARTTLS
          (thanks, Marc Bradshaw!)

1.300035  2020-10-10 12:34:29-04:00 America/New_York
        - drop some needless version checking from the days when we worked with
          broken Net::SMTPs (thanks, Bernhard Graf and Aristotle Pagaltzis and
          Pali Rohár)
        - documentation tweaks and spelling corrections (thanks, James E
          Keenan, Stefan Hornburg, M Somerville, and jazzkutya)

1.300034  2019-12-02 22:21:58-05:00 America/New_York
        - add documentation for the SMTP "hosts" parameter!

        - no changes since 1.300031

1.300032  2019-11-15 00:32:03-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
        - SMTP transport can now accept a "hosts" init arg instead of just
          "host"; this argument is an arrayref of host names to try in order
          (thanks, Marc Bradshaw!)

1.300031  2017-04-04 14:35:42-04:00 America/New_York
        - EMAIL_SENDER_TRANSPORT did not properly handle the =-prefix case
          Now: =Foo::Bar expands to Foo::Bar, Foo::Bar expands to Foo::Bar,
          and FooBar expands to Email::Sender::Transport::FooBar, as intended.

          Previously, =Foo::Bar expanded to Email::Sender::Transport::Foo::Bar

1.300030  2016-10-03 18:33:57-04:00 America/New_York

1.300024  2016-03-19 14:13:16-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
        - Net::SMTP 3.07 is now required, both for SSL support and for a fix
          to datasend implementation referenced in 1.300019 changes

        - when SMTP connection fails, include host and port in error

1.300020  2015-09-03 14:00:04-04:00 America/New_York
        - no changes since 1.300019

1.300019  2015-08-10 15:48:02-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
        - only work around Net::SMTP on broken (pre-3.07) versions
        - avoid uninitialized warning when delivering to Maildir

1.300018  2015-05-27 15:28:44-04:00 America/New_York
        - stable release of changes from 1.300017

1.300015  2014-09-12 22:01:37-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
          [THIS MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]
        - version 1.300008 was meant to rewrite line endings when sending to
          sendmail, but the change was not effective; it has been fixed

1.300014  2014-08-28 14:21:26-04:00 America/New_York
        - do not try passing an empty string as a Failure message

1.300013  2014-08-28 11:00:16-04:00 America/New_York
        - sometimes, if no error is given and $smtp->message returns (),
          the arguments to the Failure constructor were out of alignment and
          the failure's error message would be "code"; this has been fixed

1.300012  2014-07-10 09:55:35-04:00 America/New_York
        - documentation fix: there's no Email::MIME->delete_header
          (thanks, Kris Matthews)

1.300011  2014-03-02 18:16:12-05:00 America/New_York
        - run the sendmail program with -i by default (thanks, William Blunn)
        - do not die when a race causes mkpath(Maildir/new) to fail because the
          directory already exists

1.300010  2014-01-11 14:15:13-05:00 America/New_York
        - the SMTP transport now has a "debug" option

1.300009  2013-09-01 12:03:06 America/New_York
          see also 1.300008!

          switch to automatic determination of prereqs to improve accuracy

1.300008  2013-09-01 09:39:13 America/New_York
          [THIS MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]
          at long last, Sendmail and Maildir transports replaces CRLF with CR
          before piping

          [BUG FIXES]
          fixes a bug where recipients beginning with a - would not work with
          the Sendmail transport [rt.perl.org #66246]

          require Email-Abstract 3.006, to get Email-Simple 1.998, to get
          Email::Simple->new(\$str), resolving [rt.perl.org #85926]

1.300007  2013-03-19 14:58:27 America/New_York
          when sending over SMTP, send DATA in hunks of 1 mebibyte or smaller

1.300006  2013-03-17 17:23:21 America/New_York
          re-fix the problem with attribute accessors and role methods
          clashing, previously fixed in 0.102360

1.300005  2013-02-14 11:37:09 America/New_York
          add missing prereq, Sub::Exporter; thanks for report, Esteban
          Manchado Velázquez

1.300004  2013-02-09 10:09:02 America/New_York
          bump required version of MooX::Types::MooseLike

1.300003  2013-02-06 15:56:53 America/New_York
          make Wrapper transports proxy is_simple and allow_partial_success to
          the wrapped transport

          allow Wrapper transports to construct their own targets; useful for
          configuring entire wrapper chain from the environment

1.300002  2013-02-06 14:06:24 America/New_York
          THIS IS A BIG DEAL:  see v1.300000

          this is the first non-trial release using Moo instead of Moose

          increase version of Moo to interoperate with ancient Mouse.pm

1.300001  2013-01-07 21:38:31 America/New_York
          increase required versions of Throwable and Moo

1.300000  2013-01-02 22:42:58 America/New_York
          THIS IS A BIG DEAL:

          use Moo instead of Moose (thanks to Justin Hunter and Christian
          Walde!)

0.120002  2012-09-11 14:43:07 America/New_York
          added shift_deliveries to the Test transport, for treating the
          sent messages like a queue of things to inspect

0.120001  2012-07-19 16:28:01 America/Los_Angeles
          no changes from 0.120000, just marked as stable release

0.120000  2012-05-08 20:53:43 America/New_York
          THIS IS A BIG DEAL:

          This release deprecates the scalar context behavior of:

          * Failure->recipients
          * Failure::Multi->failures
          * Failure::Multi->recipients
          * Transport::Test->deliveries
          * Transport::Failable->failure_conditions

          Until now, these methods returned a list in list context and
          an array reference in scalar context.  This still works, but
          scalar context calls will now generate a warning.  In one
          year (2013-05), they will be become fatal.

0.110005  2012-03-05 21:37:35 America/New_York
          binmode output handle to avoid line ending munging in Mbox and
          Maildir; thanks, Christian Walde!

0.110004  2012-02-21 17:47:35 America/New_York
          import the "Bcc" page from the (otherwise empty) github wiki; this
          adds some information to the QuickStart page about why Bcc support
          isn't there and why this isn't a bug

0.110003  2012-02-01 15:09:52 America/New_York
          add the add_lines_header and add_envelope_headers attributes to
          Maildir transports

0.110002  2012-01-31 17:02:35 America/New_York
          Maildir deliveries now have a ->filename method to tell you just
          where the mail was delivered

0.110001  2011-04-03 16:32:15 America/New_York

          prevent Test::MinimumVersion test from causing a requirement on T::MV
          and, thus, PPI!  Thanks for the report, Matt S. Trout!

0.110000  2011-03-17 21:40:36 America/New_York
          provide a much clearer and more fatal error when SASL authentication
          has failed because Authen::SASL or MIME::Base64 is not available

          remove spurious prereq on Sys::Hostname::Long (thanks ABH)
          tweak some tests for truth/definedness in SMTP transport

0.102360  2010-08-24 07:47:24 America/New_York

          warnings with Moose 1.10

0.101760  2010-06-25 08:18:26 America/New_York
          fix sendmail.t with latest Capture::Tiny (Justin Hunter)

0.100460  2010-02-15 12:58:18 America/New_York
          avoid using AutoPrereq, as it brings in build_requires as requires

0.100450  2010-02-14 17:55:48 America/New_York
          allow timeout option to SMTP transport

0.100110  2010-01-11 10:43:57 America/New_York
          Email::Sender::Failure is now a Throwable::Error
          now uses Try::Tiny for internal exception handling

0.093380  2009-12-04 12:29:55 America/New_York
          bump Moose prereq to 0.70 based on feedback from ANDK

0.093110  2009-11-07

          add some more common sendmail locations to default search

0.091870  2009-07-06
          exclude unwanted methods from Email::Sender::Transport
          to suppress a new warning from Moose role composition

0.091740  2009-06-23
          no code changes
          remove prereq of Test::More 0.88; weird things happened

0.091661  2009-06-15
          THIS RELEASE MAY BREAK YOUR CODE... but probably not

          Email::Sender::Simple has been added, along with a manual
          Email::Sender is now a role
          Email::Sender::Transport is now a role, too; subclasses will break

0.004     2009-03-24
          require perl5 version 8
          move to Moose; let's not mess around, the Moose/Mouse stuff is not
          worth the minor savings

0.003     2009-03-12
          Sendmail transport now uses 2-arg open on Win32 so it can work at all

0.002     2009-01-31
          fix minor documentation errors

0.001     2009-01-02
